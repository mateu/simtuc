Tucker Tableau version of Simplex Algorithm.

The benchmark_random_matrix.pl script shows how to 
use the Models of which there are three:

* Normal Perl Numbers
* Rationals
* PDL


The normal Perl types model has OK performance and is the fastest up to around
200x200 matrices.

The Fractions (Rationals) model use the module using Math::Fractions::Cephes.
It is the slowest, but exact when starting with a tableau (matrix) of 
rationals. 

PDL Model uses the Perl Data Language for larger size problems.  It is the
fastest choice when tableau is > 200x200, tested on matrices of 2000x2000.
Don't be fooled - PDL is fast, hey it's C and fortran.
